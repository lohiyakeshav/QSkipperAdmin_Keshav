# String Catalog Errors - Fixed!

The error:
```
Multiple commands produce '.../QSkipperAdmin.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/QSkipperAdmin.build/Objects-normal/arm64/ImagePicker.stringsdata'
```

## Root Cause
This error occurs when Xcode tries to generate multiple string catalog files (`.stringsdata`) for the same component name. It's related to how Xcode processes localization in SwiftUI and happens specifically when:

1. You have multiple components with identical names (like two different `ImagePicker` components)
2. You have `.strings` files associated with those components
3. You're using Swift string localization features

## How We Fixed It

We've applied a comprehensive set of fixes:

1. **Disabled String Catalogs in Project Settings**
   - The script has modified your project settings to disable string catalog generation
   - This fixes the issue at its source by telling Xcode not to create these files

2. **Cleaned DerivedData**
   - All previous build artifacts have been removed
   - This ensures no leftover conflicting files

3. **Simplified Image Picker Implementation**
   - Replaced the previous implementation with one that doesn't rely on system localization

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Your Project in Xcode**
   - In Xcode, select Product > Clean Build Folder (Shift+Cmd+K)

2. **Build the Project**
   - Build the project (Cmd+B)
   - The errors should be gone!

3. **If Issues Persist**
   - Run the fix script again: `./QSkipperAdmin/Resources/fix_strings_catalog.sh`
   - Make sure your project is using the updated `ImagePicker` implementation
   - Try building on a clean target (like a simulator you haven't used before)

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Disabling `LOCALIZATION_PREFERS_STRING_CATALOGS` in the project
2. Setting `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS` to NO
3. Removing all `.stringsdata` files from DerivedData
4. Using a custom image picker that doesn't require system localization
